A module for Python that solves simple first and second order differential equations using neural networks.

Dr. Morten Hjorth-Jensen (Michigan State University and University of Oslo, Norway) offered this idea in a class for a project which I did, and eventually expanded into this module. His guidance gave the groundwork for this module. Code from Kristine Baluka Hein (Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway) led to the current implementation of the Neural Nets.
