Dr. Morten Hjorth-Jensen (Department of Physics and Astronomy and National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, Michigan State University and Department of Physics University of Oslo, Norway) offered this idea in a class for a project which I did, and eventually expanded into this module. His guidance gave the groundwork for this module. Code from Kristine Baluka Hein (Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway) led to the current implementation of the Neural Nets.
